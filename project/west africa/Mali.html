<h3><font color="Navy">Borders, topography and climate</font></h3>
Located in northwest Africa, Mali is landlocked between Algeria to the northeast, Niger to the southeast, Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire and Guinea to the south, and Senegal and Mauritania to the west. Most of the country consists of low-lying plains interrupted in places by rocky hills. The Sahara covers the northern third of the country. Three climatic zones follow one another from north to south: the north belongs to the Saharan zone; the interior delta of the Niger extends into the semi-arid Sahelian zone, where the transition between the desert and the wooded savannah takes place; finally, the south has a Sudanese climate.
The climate The climate in Mali outside the Saharan regions is hot and dry with average temperatures between 24 and 32 C in the south, which rise as one moves northward. Annual rainfall of about 1,400 mm in the south drops to about 1,120 mm in Bamako and less than 127 mm in the north.

<h3><font color="Navy">Characteristics and recent developments of the political system</font></h3>
De 1968 until 1991, Mali was ruled by a government that emerged from a military coup. Twice elected without opposition, the president ruled as a dictator, relying on the only legal political party, the Union Démocratique du Peuple Malien (UDPM), founded in 1979. After his overthrow in March 1991, a democratic regime was established and the first free elections were held a year later. Thus, in the first months of 1992, a series of municipal, legislative and presidential elections were held. These elections saw the victory of the Alliance for Democracy in Mali (ADEMA), which won 76 of the 129 seats in parliament, and whose presidential candidate was also elected.
Mali is now a presidential republic, based on the new constitution adopted by referendum in January 1992, which introduced a multi-party system. Under the terms of this constitution, the president, elected for a period of 5 years, appoints a prime minister who chooses the other members of the Council of Ministers. The National Assembly is made up of 129 deputies who are also elected for a 5-year term.
Mali is divided into seven administrative regions, plus the district of the capital, Bamako. Larger cities have elected mayors and city councils.
<h3><font color="Navy">Agriculture in Mali</font></h3>
Mali's economy is essentially agricultural, but harvests are almost totally dependent on the vagaries of the weather, especially flooding of the Niger and its tributaries. In 1995, agriculture employed 73 percent of the working population and contributed 44 percent of GDP. Most of the production comes from small farms practicing subsistence agriculture. The main food crops are millet, rice, sorghum, and corn. Peanuts, cotton and sugar cane are grown for export. Livestock production is also very important.
Due to drought, vegetation in Mali is scarce. With the rapid increase in population, the growing need for fuelwood has led to large-scale deforestation.
<h3><font color="Navy">Current economic situation</font></h3>
Mali remains one of the poorest countries in the world, and it continued to become poorer between 1985 and 1993, with an average annual growth rate of negative 1 percent, while its gross external debt was equal to or greater than gdP. In addition to the discontent caused by the economic crisis and the unpopularity of the structural adjustment plans implemented since 1981, there was a strong democratic aspiration. In 1992, the new president inherited a collapsing national economy. He obtained assistance from the IMF and in September Parliament passed a law favouring the privatization of public enterprises and strengthening the state's financial control over them. In September 1993, after consulting political parties and unions, the government announced a series of measures to reduce the budget deficit. The devaluation of the CFA franc in January 1994 and the introduction of austerity measures, while reducing public deficits, led to a worsening of living conditions for the population. In 1993 and 1994, the country was shaken by demonstrations by schoolchildren. Regional consultations made it possible to reopen schools and universities and to restore the social peace necessary for economic recovery. The new regime has demonstrated its willingness to resolve the social crisis through negotiation in each conflict. Its efforts to strengthen democracy, however, remain threatened by continuing economic difficulties. In 1995, the IMF approved a third annual loan to support its policy of economic stabilization and structural reform. Since then, public sector reform has continued, inflation has remained moderate, and growth has been sustained. However, the weakness of the industrial sector and the fragility of the agricultural sector remain a concern.
<h2><font color="Navy">B. Ongoing decentralization process</font></h2>
<h3><font color="Navy">History, objectives and legal framework</font></h3>
As practiced in Mali since 1993, decentralization involves, on the one hand, the creation of new territorial authorities (regions, cercles, communes) freely administered by elected councils and, on the other hand, the refocusing of the state on its regalian functions and the transfer of decision-making powers to the regional level. Privatization and trade liberalization have accompanied this process, with greater force since 1992. The communes created by the decentralization law will subsequently have to decide to group themselves into entities that have yet to be defined.
The origin of the recent decentralization policy was associated both with social pressure linked to the democratization process and with the recommendations of international organizations, particularly the World Bank, in the context of structural adjustment programs. The objectives set for decentralization were therefore democratization and the search for better conditions for local development, while improving local tax mobilization. To implement this policy, a Decentralization Mission was created, which was responsible for preparing and passing decentralization laws and texts, as well as monitoring their implementation.
<h3><font color="Navy">Fonctions, ressources et autonomie des entités décentralisées</font></h3>
Les régions, cercles et communes disposent, grâce au processus actuel de décentralisation, de nouveaux pouvoirs en matière de consultation, décision, exécution, contrôle et financement. Le financement des collectivités décentralisées est assuré par reversement d'une partie des taxes perçues, et autres taxes spécifiques. Il semblerait cependant que ces ressources soient à peine suffisantes pour assurer le fonctionnement des collectivités territoriales. Par ailleurs, le Ministère de l'administration territoriale et de la sécurité exerce une certaine tutelle sur les trois niveaux de gouvernement (région, cercles et communes) en ce qui concerne l'utilisation de ces ressources.
<h2><font color="Navy">C. La décentralisation et le développement rural</font></h2>
<h3><font color="Navy">Formes de la décentralisation et élaboration des politiques agricoles et de développement rural</font></h3>
Decentralization in rural development began in 1992 with the development of a master plan and the subsequent restructuring of the ministry (1996-1997). The process was delayed due to staff concerns about downsizing and loss of power. Decentralization for rural development combines strong deconcentration of state services with an equally strong devolution of power to civil society organizations. In the context of privatization, delegation to semi-public entities has been rather weak. In addition, the current trend is towards the end of projects in favor of programs capable of managing funds that respond to local initiatives. In any case, the region appears to be the preferred level for decentralization in Mali.
As a result, the modalities of rural development planning have changed radically, becoming essentially local and regional, with upstream formulation procedures. As a result, national policies began to incorporate a moderate but real differentiation according to region. The participation of the population in the elaboration of policies is weak for the moment, but it will develop. Indeed, it is expected that the municipalities will begin to plan their long-term and short-term actions, all of which will be fed back into local, regional and national plans and programs. The coordination of interventions that this implies has not yet reached an adequate level. However, in the case of rural facilities and infrastructure, there is a beginning of coordination between the national and regional levels on the one hand, and the donors who wish to see an important role for the regional and communal levels on the other.
<h3><font color="Navy">Agricultural support services and decentralization</font></h3>
In terms of the main support services for agriculture, the Malian model is specific in that the country depends to a large extent on external aid. Thus, while the definition of policies related to agricultural services is the exclusive responsibility of the national level, the same is not true for the financing of these services. External partners share with the national level the financing of training, extension, research and credit programs, and with the three levels of government the financing of irrigation programs. Only in the area of inputs is the national level fully responsible for financing and policy-making.
On the other hand, if one analyzes the situation of agricultural services from the point of view of their provision, the consequences of the privatization policy are notable, since the public sector has the leading role only in extension and research, and shares this role with the private sector and NGOs for training. Most strikingly, the public sector plays no role in the provision of credit, inputs and irrigation. Credit is provided by the private sector, NGOs and producer organizations; inputs by the private sector and producer organizations; and irrigation by the private sector, NGOs, producer organizations and villages.
<h3><font color="Navy">Supporting policies, constraints and evaluation of the decentralization process</font></h3>
Mali has implemented a comprehensive package of policies to support decentralization, including measures to disseminate information on the process, training programs for technical services, local authorities and the population, and support for producers' organizations. However, the main constraint on further decentralization is the weakness of the local level of government. The strengthening of local government will in turn pose new constraints related to the absence of frameworks for consultation and coordination between the interventions of the different levels of government.
<h3><font color="Navy">Future prospects</font></h3>
In all likelihood, Mali will need to deepen the institutional component of its decentralization program in the future in order to address all the constraints identified above.
