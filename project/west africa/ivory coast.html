<p style="text-align: justify;">Ivory coast is a West African country, member of the African Union.<br />
    Covering an area of ​​322,462 km2, it is bounded to the north by Mali and Burkina Faso, to the west by Liberia and Guinea, to the east by Ghana and <br />
    to the south by the Atlantic Ocean. The population is estimated at 22,671,331 inhabitants in 2014. The political and administrative capital of Côte d'Ivoire is<br />
    Yamoussoukro (Abidjan remaining the economic capital), for official language French and for currency, the CFA franc. The country is part of ECOWAS.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">First a French protectorate in 1843 and a French colony in 1893, the country gained its independence on August 7, 1960, under the leadership of Félix Houphouët-Boigny, first president of the Republic. The economy, essentially based on the production of coffee and cocoa, experienced exceptional growth during the first two decades, making Côte d'Ivoire a leading country in the West African sub-region.<br />
    Its official language is French. About 70% of the country's people understand and speak it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>weather</strong><br />
    Between 4° and 10° north latitude, the territory of Côte d'Ivoire is distant from the equator by about 400 km on its southern margins and from the Tropic of Cancer by about 1,400 km on its northern borders. The climate, generally hot and humid, therefore constitutes a transition between the equatorial and the tropical. Equatorial along the coasts, it is semiarid in the far north. Temperatures hover around 28°C on average. Two major climatic zones coexist: the equatorial climate and the tropical savannah climate, itself more or less dry. The small dry season covers the months of August and September. As for the rainy seasons, they range from May to July for the large one and from October to November for the small one. The climate<br />

<div class="su-column su-column-size-1-3"><div class="su-column-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim">
    humid savannah tropical covers the northern part of the southern forest zone and the southern part of the savannah region. Temperatures with greater amplitudes oscillate between 14°C and 33°C, with a hygrometry of 60% to 70% and annual rainfall of 1,200 mm3 in Bouaké. This climatic region also experiences four seasons:<br />
    two dry seasons, from November to March and from July to August and two rainy seasons, from June to October and from March to May.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The dry savannah climate mainly concerns the Savannah Region. The daily and annual thermal amplitudes are relatively high there, around 20°C, the humidity rate, lower than that of the south of the country, varies from 40% to 50%. The area under consideration is characterized by the intermittent presence between the months of December and February of a cool, dry wind, the harmattan. There are two seasons:<br />
    one dry, from November to June, punctuated by some rain in April, and the other rainy, covering the period from July to October. The average rainfall recorded is 1,203 mm3 in Korhogo.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY</strong><br />
    The territory of Côte d'Ivoire has the appearance of a quadrilateral, the south of which offers a frontage of 520 km on the Atlantic Ocean, in the western part of the Gulf of Guinea. The country is characterized by low relief. The land is mainly made up of plateaus and plains. The west of the country, a mountainous region, however, has some relief beyond a thousand meters (Mount Nimba culminates at 1,752 m). Apart from this region, the altitudes generally vary between 100 and 500 m; most plateaus around 200-350m.<br />
    The dominant element of these plateaus is constituted by a ferruginous armor visible on the surface in the form of rust-colored slabs, but sometimes veiled with sand, gravel or finer products.</p>
