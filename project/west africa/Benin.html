    <p>Benin is located in West Africa in the tropical zone between the equator and the Tropic of Cancer (between parallels 6°30' and 12°30' north latitude and meridians 1° and 30°40' east longitude).</p>
    <p>It is limited:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>to the north by the Republic of Niger over 277 km with 120 km bounded by the Niger River ;</li>
     <li>to the northwest by Burkina Faso (for 386 km);</li>
     <li>to the west by Togo (651 km),</li>
     <li>to the east by Nigeria (for 809 km);</li>
     <li>and to the south by the Atlantic Ocean (on 121 km).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>From north to south, it extends over 700 km; the width varies from 125 km (along the coast) to 325 km (at the latitude Tanguiéta-Ségbana).</p>
    <p>The country is quite flat. There are five (05) natural regions:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>A coastal strip, low and sandy, limited by lagoons (coconut groves);</li>
     <li>A central plain, hilly and monotonous, which rises progressively from 200 to 400 m from the south to the north in the vicinity of Nikki and then drops to the Niger valley and the Kandi basin. The Kandi basin in the northeast is a plain drained by the Sota River and its tributaries that flow in very wide valleys;</li>
     <li>The Atacora chain in the northwest, where the highest point of the country, Mount Aledjo (658m) is located;</li>
     <li>The vast Gourma plain in the extreme northwest, between Atacora and the border with Burkina Faso and Togo.</li>
     <li>The humid savannah occupies most of the country. A few patches of primary forest remain in the south and center. Crops, swampy areas and the immense palm grove of Bas-Benin occupy the rest of the territory.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The Climate</h3>
    <p>Benin has two (02) types of climate:</p>
    <p>In the south, an equatorial climate with high humidity. Alternating dry seasons (November to March and mid-July to mid-September) and rainy seasons (April to mid-July and mid-September to October).</p>
    <p>In the center and the north, a tropical climate. A dry season from November to April and a rainy season from June to September.</p>
    <p>The harmattan, a hot and dry wind from the Sahara, blows over the entire country during the dry season.</p>
    <p>In Cotonou, temperatures have a small range: maximums vary from 28 to 32°C and minimums from 23 to 26°C. The annual rainfall in this city is 1245 mm.</p>
    <p>The relief of Benin is not very hilly and includes :</p>
    <ul>
     <li>a coastal region, low and sandy limited by lagoons;</li>
     <li>a plateau of ferruginous clay;</li>
     <li>a silico-clay plateau, dotted with some undergrowth;</li>
     <li>an the northwest, the Atacora massif (800 meters);</li>
     <li>to the north-east, the plains of Niger, silico-clayey and very fertile.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Hydrography of Benin</h3>
    <p>Several rivers cross the country.</p>
    <p>The Beninese basin of the Niger River which includes the rivers :</p>
    <ul>
     <li>the Mekrou : 480 km;</li>
     <li>Alibori: 427 km;</li>
     <li>la Sota: 254 km;</li>
     <li>and the Pendjari.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Volta River Basin which includes:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>the Pendjari (420 km) ;</li>
     <li>the Perma.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Mono-Couffo basin which includes :</p>
    <ul>
     <li>the Couffo: 190 km long river (170 km of which is in Benin), which flows into the Ahémé lagoon, which itself flows into the Atlantic Ocean;</li>
     <li>the Mono: with its 500 km, it serves as a border between Benin and Togo on its lower course and then flows into the Atlantic Ocean.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Ouémé basin: with its 608 km, the Ouémé flows into the Nokoué lagoon and uses the Lagos and Cotonou channels to communicate with the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
    <p>There are also several water bodies in the south:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Lake Nokoué: 138 km2;</li>
     <li>Lake Ahémé : 78 Km2;</li>
     <li>and the lagoon of Porto-Novo: 35 km2.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Vegetation and fauna</h3>
    <p>Three (03) types of vegetation characterize Benin:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>the wooded savannah in the northern Sudanese regions ;</li>
     <li>the savannah in the center with species such as mahogany, Iroko, Samba ;</li>
     <li>and the forest in South and Middle Benin.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As for the fauna, there are two (02) national parks in the North:</p>
    <ul>
